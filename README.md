## Backstory
Welcome. You are seeing the first semi-complex app brainchild of an ex-medical researcher and ex-pharmacist. Given my background, and the fact that I will be working for an insurance company, I decided to create an app that targets insurance companies as clients. 

### What does the app do?
1. Takes patient data (HIPAA sensitive data, health data, insurance/financial data) and populates a database that manages the data
2. Allows you to use that data to 'predict' certain expensive health outcomes for individual patients and for the population as a whole
3. Takes those predictions and makes recommendations on what individuals / the population should do to adequately insure themselves
